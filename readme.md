Use AJAX to Control Robot Arm
=============

This will be an example sweep in controlling robot arms with an AJAX form.  As of right now, the arm can be controlled by hardcoding values in PHP.

The serial class is a modified version of the PHP Serial class by Xowap (https://github.com/Xowap/PHP-Serial).

Kyle Granat from Trossen Robotics wrote the original arm.php code (https://github.com/kgranat).
